# GIS
These codes encapsulate the foundations for spatial data processing.
The R scripts were primarily written for educational purposes, revolving around a university GIS course, and this is the reason why each Rmd file is been called with a specific assognment name.
The assignment_1 code attempts to replicate some papers in this field with a distinctly economic approach. The data I've worked with relates to attributes such as roads, population density, or electrical connections of various countries around the world, such as Brazil, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and South Africa. I please you to pay attention to these data since they are quite large, and downloading it might cause some issues. I will soon create a folder containing the data I used, which will then be publicly available.
