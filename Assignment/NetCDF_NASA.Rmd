*Paper:* Porteous, O., 2019. High trade costs and their consequences: An estimated dynamic model of African
agricultural storage and trade. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 11(4), pp.327-66.

*Tasks:* download the paperâ€™data, combine with world and transportation data to:
1- Generate an sf MULTIPOINT feature of markets across Africa and plot it;
2- Calculate minimum distance of each market to the (i) nearest road, and (ii) nearest port, (iii) nearest
airport;
3- Produce 3 scatter plots relating market average prices to the minimum distances.

*Note*: the paper appendix contains a lot of useful information about the market price data
